# Teleco-Customer-Churn-Analysis
Telecommunications Customer Churn Analysis This project analyzes a telecommunications dataset to understand customer churn patterns and uncover key factors contributing to churn. The analysis leverages data cleaning, visualizations, and statistical insights to identify actionable recommendations for improving customer retention.
Key Highlights
Objective:

Identify and quantify customer churn trends.
Analyze the impact of demographic factors, tenure, and service usage on churn.
Data Overview:

The dataset includes information on customer demographics, service details, tenure, monthly charges, and churn status.
Data cleaning was performed to handle missing values (e.g., replacing blanks in "Total Charges" with 0 when tenure is 0).
Analysis & Visualizations:

A total of 9 visualizations illustrate key insights, including:
Churn rates by demographics (e.g., senior citizens vs. non-senior citizens).
Tenure-based churn trends (e.g., high churn in the first 1â€“2 months).
Service usage patterns and their correlation with churn.
Findings:

26.54% of customers have churned.
Senior citizens and customers with shorter tenures are more likely to churn.
Recommendations:

Improve onboarding experiences to engage new users.
Offer tailored services or discounts to senior citizens.
Implement loyalty programs to retain long-term customers.
Tools & Technologies:
Python
Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
This project serves as a practical example of customer churn analysis and provides valuable insights for data-driven decision-making in customer retention strategies.
